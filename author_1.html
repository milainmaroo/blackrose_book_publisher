            <h2>Lee Child</h2>
            <p>Lee Child focuses on thriller novels and is famous for his Jack Reacher novel series. He has won the Anthony Award and the Barry Award for his novel, <span class="book-title">Killing Floor</span>. Some books in the Reacher series are written in the first person, while others are written in the third person. Lee Child has characterised the books as revenge stories – "Somebody does a very bad thing, and Reacher takes revenge" – driven by his anger at the downsizing at Granada. Although English, he deliberately chose to write American-style thrillers. <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Child" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
